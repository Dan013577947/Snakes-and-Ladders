Snakes and Ladders is a final group project in one of my subjects in College. There are mini and large Pythons on the way which give demotion and Ladders which gives promotions. A dice based game, click 'y' each time to roll a dice and move forward. The game includes
data manipulation and algorithms. I earned money with this game after selling it to my classmates, I also taught them Python language and explained how my program works.
I included a video of it working in my fb, feel free to watch my work :) https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1CrK9MEjZW/

This is a video of me on 2022 teaching my classmates https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XT6Dam6_Mtn7xvx23NcTR5Y2w_6nRcWz/view?usp=sharing (I have the permission to record with the people on this video and share it). I sold the program to lots of my classmates and I also sent them this video to understand the codes
