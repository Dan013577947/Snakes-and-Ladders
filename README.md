# Snakes and Ladders
## Overview
Snakes and Ladders is a final group project in one of my subjects in College. There are mini and large Pythons on the way which give demotion and Ladders which gives promotions. A dice based game, click 'y' each time to roll a dice and move forward. The game includes
data manipulation and algorithms. I earned money with this game after selling it to my classmates, I also taught them Python language and explained how my program works. I sold the program to my classmates and I also sent them a video to understand the codes. 
I included a video of it working in my Facebook and Youtube Channel, feel free to watch my work :)
