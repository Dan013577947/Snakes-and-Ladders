Snakes and Ladders is a final group project in one of my subjects in College. There are mini and large Pythons on the way which gives demotion and Ladders which gives promotions. A dice based game, click 'y' each time to roll a dice and move forward. The game includes
data manipulation and algorithms. I earned money with this game after selling it to my classmates, I also taught them Python language and explained how my program works.
I included a video of it working in my fb, feel free to watch my work :) https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1CrK9MEjZW/
